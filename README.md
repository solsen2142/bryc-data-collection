# BRYC Data Collection
Data collection and analysis scripts used to analyze student grade data at local nonprofit during 2019-2020 school year.

The <a href="https://www.thebryc.org">Baton Rouge Youth Coalition (BRYC)</a> is a Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based nonprofit that prepares high-achieving, under-resourced high school students to enter, excel in, and graduate from college so they can become full participants in society. Of particular interest is student eligibility for TOPS, a state-run college scholarship program, which is often the deciding factor in whether a student can afford to attend university. Eligibilty is based primarily on two factors: ACT score and "Core" high school GPA.

To more effectively determine which students (known as Fellows) needed assistance in reaching eligibility, grade data for all 250+ Fellows was collected and analyzed via Google Scripts. This data was then used by teams across the organization when creating academic plans for each Fellow. The scripts included in this repo represent only part of the data collection pipeline now used at BRYC and are meant to give an idea of the overall data goals of the organization.
